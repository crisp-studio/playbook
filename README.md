# Docsy

Docsy is a documentation generator like GitBook, but based on GatsbyJS. I wanted
an alternative to GitBook that can be deployed to Netlify so our content editors can
use GitHub to make pull requests, have branch previews, etc.

## Demo

A demo of Docsy is available at https://docsy.netlify.com
