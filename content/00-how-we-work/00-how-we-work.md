# A typical workday

## Working hours

A normal workday consists of eight working hours. We believe that spending 40 hours a week at work is plenty of time to do great things. Working more hours does not help to improve the results in the long run. The opposite is the case, working more hours sets wrong expectations for both clients and employees and creates an unhealthy workplace. We, therefore, discourage working overtime and try to keep each of us accountable.

**Start:** 8:30 AM ‚Äì 9:30 AM  
**Lunch:** 12:30 PM ‚Äì 01:30 PM  
**Finish:** 05:30 PM

## Working environment

We are currently working and operating from the [DigitalHub Aachen](https://aachen.digital), Germany. The DigitalHub is a Co-Working Space located in a beautiful church that was built in 1907. It's a great place to get to know other startups, makers and freelancers. We also get the chance to ‚Äì occasionally ‚Äì meet well-established companies that want to set foot on startup soil. Approaching people directly is the best way to get to know people here.

## Home office

Everyone is **free to work from home**, the beloved coffee shop or any other place that suits the work that seems suitable. This is especially recommended if you feel stuck in the office walls and want switch-up the day with a new environment. There are of course exceptions when it's appropriate or even necessary to meet-in-person. This is, for example, the case when we are conducting a Design Sprint with a client.

If you are working remote or from home, make sure to check-in to Slack and let the team know that you are available. üëç

## Absence

When you are working full or part-time you are expected to **be present during your agreed working schedule.** This means either to be in the office or available trough Slack. When something comes in your way or you are late, write a short message into our #organisation.

If you have an appointment, that can't be done before or after work, make sure to inform the team of your absence. It is also recommended ‚Äì if possible ‚Äì to put these appointments at the start or end of the day. This doesn't break the day in pieces and creates more room for meaningful work.
