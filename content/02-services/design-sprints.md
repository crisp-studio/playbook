# Design Sprints

The Design Sprint is a **Step by Step five day system** for solving big problems and testing new ideas. It was developed by [Google Ventures ](http://www.gv.com/sprint/)and it's been used a lot since then for **building better products faster**. Compared to the creative Design Thinking approach it's a little bit more logical, cold and specific. For us at Crisp Studio the reason why we chose to use Sprints is because it's a really obvious and simple way to start working on a product and to make sure you are validating ideas. The status quo approach for developing new products is _Idea - Build - Launch - Learn_ but during this process the _Build_ part tends to stretch out the process longer and longer with no actual data and validation on the go. Closing this loop and making it a lot smaller by **validating and getting data on a product or idea before spending all the time building** is really what the Design Sprint is all about.
