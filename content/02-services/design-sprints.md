# Design Sprints

The Design Sprint is a **step by step five day process** for solving big problems and testing new ideas. It was developed by [Google Ventures ](http://www.gv.com/sprint/)and is used by companies like Slack, Netflix, and Airbnb to make faster progress.

A Design Sprint is always time-boxed and therefore helps to compress what would normally be months of time, into a single week. It's intense and productive, but fun at the same time.

One major goal in the Design Sprint is to create a realistic prototype. The prototype makes ideas tangible and specific. This opens up the opportunity for real customer feedback and data before making any expensive commitments.

## Basic Process

- **Monday:** Defining the challenge and picking a target
- **Tuesday:** Sketching solutions on paper
- **Wednesday:** Making decisions and generate testable hypothesizes
- **Thursday:** Building a high-fidelity prototype
- **Friday:** Testing the prototype with users
