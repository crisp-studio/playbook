# About

Welcome to the Crisp Studio playbook! The playbook is a continuous effort to write down the principles and processes of this company. Things that are written down here become tangible and can, therefore, be adapted, discussed and improved. It is a **living document that evolves with the company** and should reflect our thoughts at any time.

The Playbook acts as a compass and information resource for employees, but we invited everyone to take a read. This is the place for clients to get to know us. This is the place for other agencies/studios to find inspiration or message us new ideas.

<hint type="info">
We believe in the idea of treating your company as a product. In the same notion, this playbook can be understood as the documentation for working in and with Crisp Studio. Our ambition is to update this every two months.
