# About

Crisp Studio is a **Digital Product Studio**. We support companies in validating, developing and quickly bringing new and innovative product ideas to market. Together with the customer team, we develop a tangible prototype tested by real users within a five day Design Sprint. With promising user feedback we go one step further and develop a minimal viable product in a very short timeframe. We apply the same process ourselves by transforming internal and external ideas into SaaS \(Software as a service\) solutions and placing them on the market.

We believe in the idea of treating your company as a product. Therefore we want to write down as much as possible about the inner workings of Crisp Studio. This version is a WIP. Over time we will fill further information.
