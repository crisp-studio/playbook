# Purpose

## What is a Venture?

The venture is _a risky or daring journey or undertaking_. For us, a venture is, when we develop a digital product on our own, that is useful for others and generates monthly recurring revenue. Most of the time, this is something we feel is missing in the market and that we are eager to bring to people.

## Practice what we preach

When we develop our own products, we can experiment with methods and technology in a safe environment. This helps us to grow the experience and confidence in our competences and to stay up to date.

## The process

Everyone can submit ideas in form of written pitches at any time. The ideas are then collected and discussed at the ideation breakfast. In the end, one idea is chosen. Using the Design Sprint we develop a quick prototype and test it with users. After that, we gather feedback and jump into development.
