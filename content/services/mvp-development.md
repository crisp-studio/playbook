# MVP Development

> A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after considering feedback from the product's initial users.

At Crisp Studio, we develop and release an MVP in a span of two weeks after the product’s design sprint is completed with positive feedback. The MVP can be an app for Android and iOS, a web app or a website.

## Technology

To develop an MVP, we make use of a specific set of existing technologies. These include:

- **[GitHub][2]** for version control and collaboration
- **[React][3]**, **[React Native]()** and **[Expo][5]** for app development
- **[Gatsby][6]** and **[Prismic][7]** for website development

## Support

Supporting old platforms adds a hefty additional workload to the schedule of developing an MVP in two weeks, so we will only target platforms that are less than two years old and are used by more than 1% of users [(current list)](https://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+years%2C+not+%3C+1%25). As of this version of documentation, this includes:

- Chrome for Android 70 and newer
- Safari for iOS 11.0 and newer
- Chrome 63 and newer
- Firefox 62 and newer
- Safari 11.1 and newer
- Opera 56 and newer
- Edge 17 and newer
